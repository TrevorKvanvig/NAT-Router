# NAT-Router
Network Address Translation Router

this  script enables devices within the private network to access resources on the public network (e.g., the internet) using a shared public IP address. It also ensures that responses from external servers are correctly routed back to the requesting devices within the private network. This script can be useful in scenarios where a small network needs to share a single public IP address for internet access while maintaining security and managing internal IP address assignments.
